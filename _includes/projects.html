                    <span class="project-title"><a>Maturation of brain reward system associated with developmental changes in sensation seeking and alcohol use</a></span> -<span class="project-tagline">The main goals are 1). Quantify developmental changes in the brain reward system from adolescence and adulthood. 2) Examine how behavioural changes (i.e., sensation seeking and alcohol misuse) coincide with the maturation of brain reward system.</span>

P3 and FRN are modualted by RPE and have different amplitude between binge drinkers and non-binge drinkers </span>

                    <span class="project-title"><a>Bayesian analysis with EEG Stop Signal Task</a></span> -<span class="project-tagline">When people see a sequence of go and stop trials in SST, their belief of next trial being a stop trial will change according to types of previous trials in a Bayesian fashion. The belief updating can be modelled using dynamic belief model (DBM). The electrophysiological correlates underlying this Bayesian update of belief will be examined using multiple linear regression.</span>

These alterations in reward sensitivity often contribute to the emergence of impulsive decisions and risk-taking behaviours and reward system dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous psychiatric disorders during adolescence. Therefore, an understanding of the neurobiology underlying reward processing in adolescents is important. The functional neuroanatomy and connectivity of reward processing have been extensively described in adults, with relatively less research on adolescents. There is a limited number of empirical investigations into adolescent reward processing and extant studies often employ small sample sizes (Bjork, et al., 2004; Bjork, et al., 2010). Consequently, much of the current information is derived from meta-analyses that amalgamate data from a range of different reward-related tasks with widely different methodological parameters (Silverman, et al., 2015).</span>

                    <span class="project-title"><a href="https://github.com/zh1peng/ManualQC" target="_blank">A handy GUI for EEG quality control</a></span> -<span class="project-tagline">Currently, more algorithms have been developed to automatically detect and remove EEG artefacts, but manual inventions are still needed. When I started running QC on EEG data two years ago, I had to click the menu multiple times to load dataset, remove bad epoches, interpolate bad channels, remove ICs and save dataset. I couldn’t find an efficient way to do that from eeglab, so I incorporated QC related functions from eeglab and assembled them into one GUI. The features are: all GUI are built by code, eeglab functions are customized to meet the needs.</span>

Though it took me about 1-2 month to do this course by myself, I gained a much deeper understanding of the fMRI data analysis by doing this.</span>
